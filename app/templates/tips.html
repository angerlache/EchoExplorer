    <h3>Tips to use the application!</h3>

    <br>

    <h4>ONLY WAV FILES ARE SUPPORTED CURRENTLY</h4>

    <br>

    <h4>Waveform</h4>
    <p>Choose your file, then push on 'Vizualise Audio' button</p>
    <p>You can choose the number of seconds displayed by the waveform, if your audio is longer, navigate with the buttons previous and next or the slider 'Timestep' </p>

    <br>

    <h4>Regions</h4>
    <p>Create a region by hand by with your mouse (click and drag)</p>
    <p>To delete a region: 'Ctrl'+click on it</p>
    <p>To annotate a region: 'Shift'+click on it. You can select a specy for it and write some note, then click on save.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Audio processing</h4>
    <p>You must be logged in to be able to analyse your selected audio</p>
    <p>Push on 'Process' button and choose the AI you want</p>
    <p>'BatML' should be the best for analysing bats' screams: outputs a category of species (see 'Species Description')</p>
    <p>You can also try 'BattyBirdNET' for bats' screams: outputs a specific specy</p>
    <p>'BirdNET' should be used for anything other than bats: outputs a specific specy</p>
    <p>A message will show up when the result is here and the table will be filled in (if any)</p>
    <p>Becareful you might have duplicates if you reuse the same AI on an already analysed audio</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Table</h4>
    <p>Click on a row and the region clicked will be putted in evidence</p>
    <p>Sort the table by name, time, or probability</p>
    <p>Filter the table by species with the button 'Select'</p>
    <p>Filter the table with a ceritude probability threshold with the slider 'Probability'</p>
    <p>Look for a particular specy? use the 'Search' tool</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Labels button</h4>
    <p>You can dowload a csv of your current audio, with all your regions and labels given by an AI</p>
    <p>You can save all your regions and labels given by an AI</p>
    <p>You can load the labels of your current audio if you have analised it before</p>
    <p>Share it, make visible your audio with all your regions and labels given by an AI</p>
    <p>Note that analysing your audio, will automatically save and share it, but you can reuse these buttons if you did additional manual annotations</p>

    <br>

    <h4>All audios button</h4>
    <p>There you can see all audios you have uploaded and reuse them</p>
    <p>You can also see the audios of all other users, with the results given by one of the AI, and reuse them</p>
    <p>Note that selecting a file from these list can take a dozen seconds</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Expert role</h4>
    <p>As an expert user, you have the opportunity to review and validate the labels generated by the AI system.
    Your contributions will help us refine our AI model and provide more accurate results.
    When using our app, you can choose to keep the labels provided by the AI, remove labels where necessary, and even add new labels manually if the AI missed any.
    <p>All you have to do is to click on the button 'Labels' and select 'Validate' when your are satisfied with all the annotations on the waveform.
    If you are not sure about a label, you can delete it or keep it and write a note explaining your uncertainty.</p> 
    <p>Additionally, expert users can access the list of all audio files shared by our community and label them accordingly.
    This allows you to contribute to the labeling process even further, providing valuable insights and expertise to our AI development efforts.</p>
    <p>To access this functionality, we kindly ask expert users to send us an email with proof of their expertise in bat scream detection. Once verified, we will grant you access to the label submission feature.</p>
