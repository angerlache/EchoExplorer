    <h3>Tips to use the application!</h3>

    <br>

    <h4>Waveform</h4>
    <p>Choose your file, then push on 'Vizualise Audio' button</p>
    <p>If your file is longer than a minute, navigate with the buttons previous and next or the slider 'Timestep'</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Regions</h4>
    <p>Create a region by hand by with your mouse (click and drag)</p>
    <p>To delete a region: 'Ctrl'+click on it</p>
    <p>To annotate a region: 'Shift'+click on it. You can select a specy for it and write some note, then click on save.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Audio processing</h4>
    <p>You must be logged in to be able to analyse your selected audio</p>
    <p>Push on 'Process' button and choose the AI you want</p>
    <p>'BatML' should be the best for analysing bats' screams: outputs a category of species</p>
    <p>You can also try 'BattyBirdNET' for bats' screams: outputs a specific specy</p>
    <p>'BirdNET' should be used for anything other than bats: outputs a specific specy</p>
    <p>A message will show up when the result is here and the table will be filled in (if any)</p>
    <p>Becareful you might have duplicates if you reuse the same AI on an already analysed audio"></audio></p>

    <br>

    <h4>Table</h4>
    <p>The table makes more sense with the use of 'AI bats' because it uses the categories of bats (see 'Species Description')</p>
    <p>Click on a row and the region clicked will be putted in evidence</p>
    <p>Sort the table by name, time, or probability</p>
    <p>Filter the table by species with the button 'Select'</p>
    <p>Filter the table with a ceritude probability threshold with the slider 'Probability'</p>
    <p>Look for a particular specy? use the 'Search' tool</p>

    <br>

    <h4>All audios button</h4>
    <p>There you can see all audios you have uploaded and reuse them</p>
    <p>You can also see the audios of all other users, with the results given by one of the AI, and reuse them</p>
    <p>Note that selecting a file from these list can take a dozen seconds</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Labels button</h4>
    <p>You can dowload a csv of your current audio, with all your regions and labels given by an AI</p>
    <p>You can save all your regions and labels given by an AI</p>
    <p>You can load the labels of your current audio if you have analised it before</p>
    <p>Share it, make visible your audio with all your regions and labels given by an AI</p>
    <p>Note that analysing your audio, will automatically save and share it, but you can reuse these buttons if you did additional manual annotations</p>
